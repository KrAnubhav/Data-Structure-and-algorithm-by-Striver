# 🧩 Common DSA Patterns

A collection of standard patterns to solve algorithmic problems.

---

## 1. Sliding Window
**Used for:** Array/String problems involving subarrays or substrings.
- Fixed Size Window
- Variable Size Window

## 2. Two Pointers
**Used for:** Sorted arrays, finding pairs, reversing.
- Opposite ends
- Same direction (Fast & Slow)

## 3. Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise & Hare)
**Used for:** Cycle detection in Linked List/Array.

## 4. Merge Intervals
**Used for:** Overlapping intervals problems.

## 5. Cyclic Sort
**Used for:** Arrays containing numbers in a given range (1 to N).

## 6. In-place Reversal of Linked List
**Used for:** Reversing links without extra space.

## 7. Tree BFS
**Used for:** Level-order traversal.

## 8. Tree DFS
**Used for:** Pre-order, In-order, Post-order.

## 9. Two Heaps
**Used for:** Median of data stream, scheduling.

## 10. Subsets (Backtracking)
**Used for:** Permutations, Combinations.

## 11. Modified Binary Search
**Used for:** Search in mostly sorted or rotated arrays.

## 12. Top 'K' Elements
**Used for:** Finding top/smallest K elements (Heaps/QuickSelect).

## 13. K-way Merge
**Used for:** Merging K sorted lists.

## 14. Topological Sort (Graph)
**Used for:** Dependency resolution, task scheduling.
