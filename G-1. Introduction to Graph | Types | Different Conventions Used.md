# G-1. Introduction to Graph | Types | Different Conventions Used

## 📚 What is a Graph?

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. It doesn't necessarily have to be a circular or enclosed structure - it can be open as well!

---

## 🔹 Basic Terminologies

### 1. **Nodes / Vertex**
- The circular things in a graph are called **nodes** or **vertex**
- Nodes are represented by numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.)
- **Important:** There is NO specific order in which you number the nodes - numbering can be in any order!
- **Number of nodes** = N or V (where V = number of vertices)

### 2. **Edges**
- The lines connecting two nodes are called **edges**
- Edges represent the connection/relationship between nodes

---

## 📊 Types of Graphs

### **1. Undirected Graph**

```
    1 ---- 2
    |      |
    4 ---- 3
     \    /
       5
```

**Characteristics:**
- Edges have **NO arrows**
- Edges are called **undirected edges**
- **Bi-directional:** If there's an edge between node U and V, you can travel:
  - From U → V
  - From V → U
- An undirected edge between U and V means there's an edge in BOTH directions

---

### **2. Directed Graph**

```
    1 --→ 2
    ↓      ↓
    4 ←-- 3
     ↘    ↙
       5
```

**Characteristics:**
- Edges have **arrows** (directed edges)
- **Unidirectional (by default):** If there's a directed edge from 1 → 4:
  - You can go from 1 to 4
  - But you CANNOT go from 4 to 1
- **Can have bi-directional edges:** You can have both 1 → 4 AND 4 → 1 as separate edges

## 🔄 Cycles in Graphs

### What is a Cycle?
**Definition:** A cycle exists when you **start from a node and end at the same node** via some path.

### Types Based on Cycles:

#### **1. Undirected Cyclic Graph**
```
    1 ---- 2
    |      |
    4 ---- 3
     \    /
       5
```
- Has at least ONE cycle
- Example cycles: 1 → 2 → 5 → 4 → 1 or 2 → 3 → 5 → 2

#### **2. Undirected Acyclic Graph**
```
    1 ---- 2
    |      
    4      3
           |
           5
```
- Has NO cycles
- Cannot start and end at the same node

#### **3. Directed Cyclic Graph**
```
    1 --→ 2
    ↑      ↓
    4 ←-- 3
```
- Has at least ONE cycle in the directed path
- Example: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1

#### **4. Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
```
    1 --→ 2
    ↓      ↓
    4      3
     ↘    ↙
       5
```
- **NO cycles** in directed paths
- Commonly known as **DAG**
- Very important in graph algorithms!

## 🛤️ Path in a Graph

### Definition:
A **path** contains a lot of vertices/nodes where **each of them are reachable** from one another.

### Rules for a Valid Path:

```
Graph: 1 --- 2 --- 3 --- 4 --- 5
```

✅ **Valid Paths:**
- `1 → 2 → 3 → 5` (all nodes connected sequentially)
- `1 → 2 → 3 → 4`

❌ **Invalid Paths:**
- `1 → 2 → 3 → 2 → 1` (node 2 appears twice - **NOT allowed**)
- `1 → 3 → 5` (no direct edge from 1 to 3 - **NOT reachable**)

### Important Rules:
1. **A node CANNOT appear twice in a path**
2. **Adjacent nodes in the path MUST have an edge between them**

---

## 📐 Degree in Graphs

### For Undirected Graphs:

**Degree** = Number of edges attached to a node

```
    1 ---- 2
    |      |
    4 ---- 3
     \    /
       5
```

**Calculating Degrees:**
- Degree of node 1 = 2 (connected to 2 and 4)
- Degree of node 2 = 2 (connected to 1 and 3)
- Degree of node 3 = 3 (connected to 2, 4, and 5)
- Degree of node 4 = 2 (connected to 1 and 5)
- Degree of node 5 = 3 (connected to 3, 4, and maybe 2)

### 🔥 Important Property:

```
Total Degree of Graph = 2 × Number of Edges
```

**Why?** Because every edge is associated with TWO nodes!

**Example:**
- Total degree = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12
- Number of edges = 6
- 2 × 6 = 12 ✅ (Property satisfied!)

---

### For Directed Graphs:

In directed graphs, we have TWO types of degrees:

#### **1. In-Degree**
- Number of **incoming edges** to a node
- Edges that point **INTO** the node

#### **2. Out-Degree**
- Number of **outgoing edges** from a node
- Edges that point **OUT OF** the node

```
    1 --→ 3 ←-- 2
          ↓
          4
```

**For Node 3:**
- **In-Degree** = 2 (edges from 1 and 2 coming in)
- **Out-Degree** = 1 (edge going to 4)

---

## ⚖️ Edge Weights

### What are Edge Weights?

Every edge can have a **weight** (or cost) associated with it.

```
        3
    1 ---- 2
    |2     |5
    4 ---- 3
   1 \6   /7
       5
```

- Edge between 1-2 has weight = 3
- Edge between 1-4 has weight = 2
- Edge between 2-3 has weight = 5
- And so on...

### Important Note:
**If weights are NOT assigned:**
- We assume **unit weights = 1** for all edges
- This is the default assumption

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Graph Structure:**
   - Nodes/Vertices (numbered in any order)
   - Edges (connections between nodes)
   - Can be open or closed structures

2. **Types:**
   - Undirected vs Directed
   - Cyclic vs Acyclic
   - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) - very important!

3. **Path Rules:**
   - No node repetition
   - Adjacent nodes must be connected

4. **Degrees:**
   - Undirected: Total edges attached
   - Directed: In-degree + Out-degree
   - Property: Total Degree = 2 × Edges

5. **Edge Weights:**
   - Can be assigned any value
   - Default = 1 (unit weight)
